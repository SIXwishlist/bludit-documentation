## <a id="advanced-mode"></a> Advanced mode
You can make a new post editing the filesystem.
- Create a directory in `/content/posts/`
- The directory name will be the uri of the new post.
- Create a new file named `index.txt` inside of the new directory.
- Edit the file `index.txt`
- Add two variables, `Title:` and `Content:`

### Example
- Create the directory `/content/posts/test`
- Create the file `index.txt` in `/content/posts/test/`
- Edit the file `index.txt`
- Add the next text

```
Title: New post test

Content:
<h1>Hello Lorem</h1>

## Subtitle for Lorem

It is a long <b>establishedfact</b> that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
