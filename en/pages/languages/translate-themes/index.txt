Title: Translate themes
Content: Each theme has a folder called `languages`, in this folder you have the different dictionary files for each language.

```
/themes/THEME_NAME/languages/
	de_DE.json
	en_US.json
	es_AR.json
	fr_FR.json
	...
```

<div markdown="1" class="note">
<div class="note-title">NOTE</div>
The default language in Bludit is the English from United States, the locale name is **en_US**, and the filename is **en_US.json**.
</div>

<div markdown="1" class="note">
<div class="note-title">NOTE</div>
All dictionary files are **JSON** files, and are saved by the encoding **UTF-8**.
</div>

This is an example of an English (United States) dictionary `en_US.json`. Each line in en_US.json file is a key-value pair with the key on the left and the value on the right.

<pre><code data-language="JSON">{
	"theme-data":
	{
		"name": "Pure",
		"description": "Simple and clean, based on the framework Pure.css.",
		"author": "Bludit",
		"email": "",
		"website": "https://github.com/dignajar/bludit-themes",
		"version": "0.6",
		"releaseDate": "2015-11-13"
	}
}
</code></pre>

As you can see, you have a field called `theme-data`, this has all the information about the theme (name, description, author, etc).

<div markdown="1" class="note">
<div class="note-title">IMPORTANT !</div>
You don't need to translate the following fields: author, email, website, version and releaseDate because Bludit takes this information from the English dictionary.
</div>

This is an example of a Spanish (Argentina) dictionary, the locale name is `es_AR` then the filename will be `es_AR.json`.

<pre><code data-language="JSON">{
	"theme-data":
	{
		"name": "Pure",
		"description": "Simple y minimalista, basado en el framework Pure.css."
	}
}
</code></pre>
