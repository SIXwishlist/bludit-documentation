Title: Translate plugins
Content: Translate a plugin is very easy, each plugin has a folder called `languages`, in this folder you have the differents dictionary for each language.

```
/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME/languages/
	de_DE.json
	en_US.json
	es_AR.json
	fr_FR.json
	...
```

*Note: The default language on Bludit is the English (United States), the locale name is en_US.*

*Note: All dictionary files are JSON files.*

---

This is an example of the English (United States) dictionary `en_US.json`. Each line in en_US.json file is a key-value pair with the key on the left and the value on the right.

<pre><code data-language="JSON"> {
	"plugin-data":
	{
		"name": "Page list",
		"description": "Shows the list of pages in order.",
		"author": "Bludit",
		"email": "",
		"website": "http://www.bludit.com",
		"version": "0.1",
		"releaseDate": "2015-08-02"
	},

    "home": "Home",
    "show-home-link": "Show home link"
}
</code></pre>

and this is an example of the Espa√±ol (Argentina) dictionary `es_AR.json`.

<pre><code data-language="JSON"> {
	"plugin-data":
	{
		"name": "Listado de paginas",
		"description": "Muestra el listado de paginas en orden."
	},

    "home": "Inicio",
    "show-home-link": "Mostrar link de la pagina de incio"
}
</code></pre>

As you can see, you have a field called `plugin-data`, this has all information about the plugin (name, description, author, etc). And the next fields are phrase for the plugin as `home` and `show-home-link`.

*Note: You don't need translate the fields author, email, website, version and releaseDate because Bludit take this information from the dictionary en_US.json.*
