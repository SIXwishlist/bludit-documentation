Title: Example: My first theme
Position: 2

First, create the folder structure, in this example I will call my new theme `Coffee`.

- Create the folder theme, inside the folder `/bl-themes/`, you will get `/bl-themes/coffee/`
- Create the folder `languages`, inside the folder `/bl-themes/coffee/`
- Create the file `index.php`, inside the folder `/bl-themes/coffee/`, with the next HTML and PHP code:

<pre><code data-language="html"><!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Bludit</title>
</head>
<body>
	<?php foreach ($posts as $Post): ?>

	<h1><?php echo $Post->title() ?></h1>
	<div><?php echo $Post->content() ?></div>

	<hr>

	<?php endforeach; ?>
</body>
</html>
</code></pre>

Create a file with the theme information; the file will be in the root theme folder, called `metadata.json`, with the next JSON code:

<pre><code data-language="php">{
	"author": "Bludit",
	"email": "",
	"website": "",
	"version": "1.0",
	"releaseDate": "2016-01-15",
	"license": "MIT",
	"compatible": "1.4",
	"notes": ""
}
</code></pre>

Next, create another file with the name and description of the theme; create a file called `en_US.json` inside the folder `/bl-themes/coffee/languages/`, with the next JSON code:

<pre><code data-language="php">{
	"theme-data":
	{
		"name": "Coffee",
		"description": "This is my first theme for Bludit."
	}
}
</code></pre>

Now you will see the theme on the **Admin panel->Settings->Themes**. This theme shows only the posts of the first page.
