## File .htaccess for Apache Webserver <a id="apache"></a>
If you are running Apache Webserver you will need the ```.htaccess``` file in your root directory and enable the [rewrite module](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html).

<pre><code data-language="bash"># Apache configuration
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

# Enable rewrite rules
RewriteEngine on

# Deny direct access to .txt files
RewriteRule ^content/(.*)\.txt$ - [R=404,L]

# All URL process by index.php
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]

</IfModule></code></pre>
