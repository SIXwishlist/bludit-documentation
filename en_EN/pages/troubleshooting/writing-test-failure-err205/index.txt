Title: Writing test failure (ERR_205)

Content:

If you get this alert when trying to install Bludit, you need to set the correct permissions to the `content` directory.

## <a id="ftp"></a> Hosting server change permissions via FTP

If you have access to your Webserver via FTP, you can set the permission right-clicking on the directory/folder `content`, set permissions. First try to set the permission to 755, if the error continues then try with 777 permission.

## <a id="linux"></a> Permissions on GNU/Linux

I recommend you to check with which user running on your Webserver, because you need to set read/write/execute permissions to the directory content. For example if you are running Apache on GNU/Linux you can do this:

```
$ sudo ps axo user | egrep '(apache|httpd)' | uniq
```

This commands returns what user is running Apache.

Now you can set the username to the directory `content`. And fix some permissions to files and directories.

```
$ cd /var/www/html/bludit
$ sudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME content
$ sudo find . -type f | xargs chmod 664
$ sudo find . -type d | xargs chmod 755
```

Other way, that I donâ€™t recommend, is setting the permissions for all read/write/execute (777).

```
$ cd /var/www/html/bludit
$ sudo chmod 777 content
```
