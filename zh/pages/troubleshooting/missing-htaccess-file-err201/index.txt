## File .htaccess for Apache Webserver <a id="apache"></a>
If you are running Apache Webserver you will need the ```.htaccess``` file in your root directory and enable the [rewrite module](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html).

<pre><code data-language="bash"># Apache configuration
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

# Enable rewrite rules
RewriteEngine on

# Deny direct access to .txt files
RewriteRule ^bl-content/(.*)\.txt$ - [R=404,L]

# All URL process by index.php
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [PT,L]

</IfModule></code></pre>

## <a id="windows"></a> How to create the file .htaccess on Windows

If you try to rename a file on Windows with the name .htaccess, an error would occur stating ```You must type a file name```. To solve this problem, create the file with **Notepad**, go to **File->Save as->Write .htaccess** and choose ```All Files``` as the type.
