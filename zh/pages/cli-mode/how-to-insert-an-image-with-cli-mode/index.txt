Title: How to insert an image with Cli Mode
Position: 4
Content:

First you need to upload the image inside the directory `/bl-content/uploads/`

Edit the file `index.txt` of the post or page, and insert the next Markdown code on the content.

```
![alt text](filename-of-the-image.jpg)
```

You can work with "folders", for example, I uploaded an image called `tux.jpg` inside the directory `/bl-content/uploads/linux/` the Markdown code to insert on the content will be:

```
![Tux](linux/tux.jpg)
```
